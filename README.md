# 📌 1. Project Overview

The **Generalised Data Structures Library** is a C++ template-based reusable library that implements both **Linear and Non-Linear Data Structures** using Generic Programming.

The main goal of this project is to:

- Build reusable data structures
- Follow clean OOP principles
- Use C++ Templates for type independence
- Provide menu-driven demonstration for easy testing
- Design a modular library for integration into client applications

This project strengthens understanding of:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Template Programming
- Dynamic Memory Management
- Searching & Sorting Algorithms
- Library Design Architecture

---

# 🏗️ 2. Project Architecture

The project is divided into two main layers:

## 🔹 Library Layer
Contains:
- Template classes
- Node structures
- Core operations
- Searching & Sorting algorithms

This layer is reusable and independent.

## 🔹 Client / Demo Layer
Contains:
- Menu Driven Interface
- User interaction
- Testing of all operations

This helps to demonstrate functionality clearly.

# 📦 3. Implemented Data Structures

## 🔵 Linear Data Structures

- Singly Linear Linked List
- Singly Circular Linked List
- Doubly Linear Linked List
- Doubly Circular Linked List
- Stack (LIFO)
- Queue (FIFO)

## 🔴 Non-Linear Data Structures

- Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - Insert
  - Delete
  - Search
  - Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)

---

# 🧠 5. Generic Implementation (Template Based)

This project uses:

```cpp
template <class T>
```

Because of templates:

- Same data structure works for int
- float
- double
- char
- string
- Custom objects

No need to rewrite code for different data types.

This makes the project:
- Scalable
- Clean
- Professional
- Industry-ready

# ⭐ 6. Highlight Feature – Menu Driven Demonstration

One of the major strengths of this project is:

## 🔥 Menu Driven Code Interface

The menu-driven system allows:

- Easy selection of data structure
- Dynamic operation testing
- Interactive execution
- Real-time result display

Example:

```
1. Singly Linear Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Stack
4. Queue
5. Binary Search Tree
6. Exit
```

# 🛡️ 7. Error Handling & Validation

The project includes:

- Invalid input validation
- Boundary condition checking
- Safe memory allocation
- Proper destructor handling
- Overflow & underflow protection (Stack/Queue)

This ensures:
- Stable execution
- Crash prevention
- Clean memory usage

# 🎯 8. Learning Outcomes

After completing this project:

✔ Strong understanding of OOP  
✔ Deep knowledge of data structures  
✔ Mastery in template programming  
✔ Implementation of sorting & searching  
✔ Experience in building reusable C++ libraries  
✔ Menu-driven system design

# 🚀 9. How to Compile and Execute

## 🔹 Using g++ Compiler

### Step 1: Open terminal
Navigate to project folder.

### Step 2: Compile

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o app
```

### Step 3: Run

```bash
./app
```

On Windows:

```bash
app.exe
```

# 🧪 10. How to Explore 

After execution:

1. Select data structure from menu
2. Choose operation (Insert, Delete, Display, Search)
3. Provide input
4. View result instantly

Use exit option to terminate program safely.
